# TaskÂ 02Â â€“ Titanic: Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis

Explore demographic, socioâ€‘economic and voyageâ€‘related factors that influenced passenger survival.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset  
Kaggle Competition: **[Titanic â€“ Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)**  
Files used: `train.csv`, `test.csv`.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   * Handle missing values (`Age`, `Cabin`, `Embarked`).  
   * Encode categoricals (Oneâ€‘Hot or Label).  
   * Outlier checks on fare/age.

2. **Exploratory Questions**  
   * How did *sex*, *class*, and *age group* affect survival?  
   * Did fare or embarkation port correlate with survival?  
   * Relationships between family size (`SibSp`â€¯+â€¯`Parch`) and outcome.

3. **Visualizations**  
   * Stacked bar plots of survival by `Sex` and `Pclass`.  
   * KDE/box plots: fare vs. survival.  
   * Heat map of feature correlations.
